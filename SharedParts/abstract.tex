This paper introduces a new problem in robotic coverage, in which a robot \rob competes with another robot \opp in order to be the first to cover an area. In the variant discussed in this paper, the {\em asymmetric competitive coverage}, \opp is unaware of the existence of \rob, which attempts to take that fact into consideration in order to succeed in being the first to cover as many parts of the environment as possible. We consider different information models of \rob, that define how much it knows about the location of \opp and its planned coverage path. We present an optimal algorithm for \rob in the full-information case. We show that unless \rob has information about \opp's initial location, it is as if having no information at all. Lastly, we show a correlation between the time it takes \rob to cover \opp's initial location and the paths quality, and present a heuristic algorithm for such case when having information only about initial location.
